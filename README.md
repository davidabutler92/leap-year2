#Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

##3 rules to be considered a leap year
*The year is divisible by 4;
*If the year can be divided evenly by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
*The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then is IS a leap year;


##Behavior              ##Input Example             ##Output Example 
*Not leap year                *2017                       *false 
*divisible by 4               *1992                       *true
*divisible by 100             *2100                       *false
*divisble by 400              *2000                       *true
